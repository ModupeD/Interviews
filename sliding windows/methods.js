 //Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree, 
 //you are given two baskets, and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket. 
 //The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.
 
 //You can start with any tree, but you canâ€™t skip a tree once you have started. 
 //You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e., 
 //you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
